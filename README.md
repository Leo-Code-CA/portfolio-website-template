## My process

### Built with

- Bootstrap 5
- SASS (compiled in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the live sass complier extension)
- A little bit of jQuery!

### What I learned
I learned so much while working on this project! I’m so glad I did it!

Before starting this tutorial, I had never worked with Bootstrap or Sass. I only knew a few things about them (what they are used for and some rudimentary syntax). After completing this tutorial and customizing it, I have the feeling to have a true basic understanding of those great tools! I can’t wait to start building a new project by myself with them!

To be a bit more precise, let’s summarize what I’ve learned into a (non-exhaustive!) list:

 - Install Node.js
 - Install Bootstrap with a npm package manager
 - Compile Sass with VS Code extension
 - Bootstrap layout (grid, flex and breakpoints)
 - Customize bootstrap by overriding its variables with Sass
 - Use GLightbox to display a video with autoplay
 - Create a carousel with Bootstrap
 - Create an accordion with Bootstrap
 - Create a portfolio gallery with Bootstrap
 - Create a form with bootstrap
 - Use Bootstrap's icons
 - Use Bootstrap's JavaScript plugins
 - Create and use Sass' mixins and animations
### Customization
After finalizing the tutorial, don't get me wrong, the result was already looking great but I was so excited to customize it a little! The modifications I made were mainly guided by aesthetic, responsive or “best practices” purposes.

Let’s list the main changes I made to the project:

 - Implement Bootstrap’s scrollspy which use the scroll position to indicate to the user which section (navigation link) is currently active in the viewport.
 - Update the order of the flex-items in the services section (mobile layout) so the text is displayed before the image for all of them.
 - Use (for the first time by myself!!!) jQuery to create a portfolio gallery with filtering.
 - Improve the alignment of some elements with different flex properties.
 - Add some media queries to improve the responsiveness.
 - Overide a few more Bootstrap variables (font-size, navbar).
